# Basecamp v0.1

Basecamp is a local-first Tauri desktop app for structured LLM project work.

It is intentionally not a generic chat client.

## Core Features

- **Brutalist IDE Environment**: A resizable three-pane layout (Explorer, Canvas, Chat) with a distinct brutalist aesthetic, Geist Pixel typography, and chamfered structural elements.
- **Multimodal & Vision Capability**: Attach images directly in the composer for analysis by vision-enabled models.
- **Rich Canvas**: Natively preview Markdown, Images, PDFs, and HTML files generated by the models inline without leaving the app.
- **Arena View**: Evaluate a single prompt against up to 4 different models concurrently with real-time parallel streaming to explore and benchmark capabilities.
- **Agentic Tooling**: Built-in system prompting forces models to use a restricted set of tools to read and write context files directly to your local file system.
- **Local-First**: All state is fully portable. Camps are simply folders containing transparent JSON and Markdown files.

## Core Concept

A **Camp** is a persistent local project folder containing:

- selected OpenRouter model
- system prompt
- structured memory (JSON)
- append-only transcript history
- local context and generated artifacts

All Camp state is directly visible on disk.

## Local File Layout

Workspace root:

```text
<workspace>/
  camps/
    <camp_id>/
      camp.json
      system_prompt.md
      memory.json
      transcript.jsonl
      artifacts/
        index.json
        <artifact_id>.md
      context/
```

Reference: [docs/v0.1-architecture.md](./docs/v0.1-architecture.md)

## Current Stack

- Tauri v2 (Rust backend)
- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- OpenRouter API
- SQLite (settings + model cache)
- OS keyring (OpenRouter API key)

## Artifact Workflow (v0.1.1)

1. Promote any transcript message into an artifact markdown file.
2. Artifacts are indexed in `artifacts/index.json` with usage metadata.
3. Select artifacts in the composer before sending a new message.
4. Selected artifact IDs are persisted on the user transcript entry (`included_artifact_ids`).
5. Request composition includes selected artifacts deterministically before transcript history.
6. Progression badge is derived locally from artifact count, reused artifact count, and conversation turns.

## Camp Setup Workflow

- Basecamp auto-initializes a default root folder at `~/Basecamp` (you can still switch via `Pick Workspace`).
- Use the **Trailhead** setup flow to create a camp workspace by selecting:
  - camp name
  - model
- model search/filter (plus refresh models in-place)
- Each new camp is created as its own local folder under `<workspace>/camps/<camp_id>/`.

## Debugging + Inspect Mode

Developer Inspect Mode is local-only and disabled by default.

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Enable `Developer Mode (Inspect)`.
3. Open a camp chat and expand the `Inspect` panel.

When enabled, Basecamp writes per-turn debug artifacts in each camp:

```text
<workspace>/camps/<camp_id>/.camp/debug/
  events.jsonl
  turn_<correlation_id>_request.json
  turn_<correlation_id>_response.json
  turn_<correlation_id>_bundle.json
```

Notes:

- Redaction is applied before writing debug files (`api_key`, auth/token/secret fields, and sensitive headers).
- Inspect logging does not change normal camp storage files (`camp.json`, `transcript.jsonl`, etc.).
- Use `Export Turn Bundle` in the Inspect panel to regenerate a deterministic per-turn JSON bundle for sharing or diffing.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run tauri dev
```

Quickest desktop launch (macOS):

1. Double-click `launch-basecamp.command` in this repo.
2. Or run `npm run desktop`.
